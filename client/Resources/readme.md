# Client Files

## Install Steps
1. Rename Nektulos_EnvironmentEmitters.txt to Nektulos_EnvironmentEmitters.txt.bak and nektulos.eqg to nektulos.eqg.bak **(IF YOU DO NOT THEN YOU CANNOT ZONE THROUGH NEKTULOS FOREST, EVER. THE PLANE OF KNOWLEDGE BOOK WILL PUT YOU UNDER THE TERRAIN.)**
2. Download the loadingscreen.jpg and GlobalLoad.txt and place them in your EverQuest/Resources directory. Replace any conflicting the files.
3. Enjoy!

## What Does This Do?
1. This will change your load screen from that awful wolf thing to a more classic asthetic, if you do not want this **do not download the loadingscreen.jpg file.**
2. It updates your *GlobalLoad.txt* to include newer models for the snakes and spiders that are normally not included with a fresh install of EverQuest Titanium. This fixes the amusing bug of giant Humanoids walking very slowly half in the ground.

## Known Client Issues
1. You will randomly gain swim skill while running through Lavastorm Mountains. This is a conflict with the old zone and new zone. I don't know how to fix this and the new zone is much better and more interesting.
2. Mobs will constantly free fall through Nektulos Forest. This is due to the newer spawn locations and the old spawn locations and the older zone being the one we use. This will take an extremely long time to fix and it's all handled server side, *by hand* and I don't have enough *hands* or **time** to fix it. Sorry!
3. Boats don't work. I can't fix it.
4. Map files may be incomplete or missing entirely. You will have to find those yourself. I highly suggest you avoid using maps though. It's way more fun that way!
