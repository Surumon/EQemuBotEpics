# Client Files

## Install Steps
1. Rename Nektulos_EnvironmentEmitters.txt to Nektulos_EnvironmentEmitters.txt.bak and nektulos.eqg to nektulos.eqg.bak **(IF YOU DO NOT THEN YOU CANNOT ZONE THROUGH NEKTULOS FOREST, EVER. THE PLANE OF KNOWLEDGE BOOK WILL PUT UNDER THE TERRAIN.)**
2. Download the loadingscreen.jpg and GlobalLoad.txt and place them in your EverQuest/Resources directory. Replace any conflicting the files.
3. Enjoy!

## What Does This Do?
1. This will change your load screen from that awful wolf thing to a more classic asthetic, if you do not want this **do not download the loadingscreen.jpg file.**
2. It updates your *GlobalLoad.txt* to include newer models for the snakes and spiders that are normally not included with a fresh install of EverQuest Titanium. This fixes the amusing bug of giant Humanoids walking very slowly half in the ground.
